### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: How Did Americans Vote
+ This project is conducted by [Minzhi Zhang]

+ Project summary:The goal of this project is to take a deeper look at the patterns and characteristics of voter behaviors from past U.S. presidential elections using the American National Election Studies (ANES) data sets. In this project I will carry out an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of survey responses from ANES and discover some interesting findings from the selected data sets. Specifically, I am interested in answering the following questions:

What is a typical voter like?
What are some patterns of behaviors that past voters might have?

Conclusion
+ Typical Voter
Based on the above exploratory data analysis, a typical voter has the following demographic characteristics:

White non-Hispanic;
woman;
aged between 45 and 64;
lives in suburban areas;
at least goes to some college, may or may not have degree;
professional or management jobs;
protestant;

+ Patterns of Voter Behaviors
Most people knew who to vote for at least two weeks before the campaign;
The majority of the voters were somehow indifferent towards the two parties, i.e. their feelings towards Democrats and Republican didn’t differ much;
